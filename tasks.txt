🔥 Just completed a User Management System project using Node.js, Express.js & MongoDB!

Built a full stack backend system with role-based access for Users and Admin. 

🔐 User Features:

🔸 Register, Login, and access a clean Home Page

🔸 Validation and prevention of duplicate accounts

🧑‍💼 Admin Features:

🔸 Admin login page

🔸 Admin dashboard to view, search, add, edit, delete user data

🔸 Proper Admin authentication before accessing dashboard

💡 What I Learned & Implemented:

✅ MVC architecture with separate routes and controllers for users and admins
✅ Password hashing using bcrypt
✅ Routing management for user and admin
✅ Middleware for session handling and routing control
✅ Server-side rendering using Handlebars(HBS)
✅ Local MongoDB connection with Mongoose
✅ Created separate models for User and Admin
✅ Used async/await for asynchronous operations
✅ Error handling using try/catch
✅ Session management using express-session
✅ Session is destroyed on logout
✅ Used nocache middleware to prevent unauthorized access to previous pages

🛠️ Tech Stack:
Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, Handlebars, JavaScript, bcrypt, express-session

🎯 This project helped me understand how a full backend system works, from creating a server, to rendering pages, connecting databases, and handling sessions securely.

Excited to continue building and learning! 💻✨
